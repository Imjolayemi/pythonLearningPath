# Python Learning Path 🐍

Welcome to my **Python Learning Path** repository!  
This repo documents my journey of learning Python step by step, from the basics to more advanced concepts, while also building small projects along the way.  

---

## 📌 Goals
- Master the fundamentals of Python (syntax, data types, control structures).  
- Learn object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python.  
- Practice problem-solving with algorithms and data structures.  
- Explore popular libraries (e.g., NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib).  
- Work on real-world projects to apply knowledge.  
- Document my progress for revision and sharing with others.

## 🚀 Projects Planned
- ✅ Basic Calculator (CLI)  
- ✅ Number Classifier (Even/Odd/Prime API in plain Python)  
- ⏳ To-Do List (file-based storage)  
- ⏳ Weather App (using an API)  
- ⏳ Farm Decision Helper (linking to my AgriTech interests 🌱)
